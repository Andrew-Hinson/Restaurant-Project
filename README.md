## Concepts learned and utilized
* ES6 Modules

## Final Thoughts:

I learned a lot about importing and exporting and separating my code. I started learning webpack and modifying the config file and the package.json file.

Keeping my code separated into different modules made this process a lot quicker and easier to navigate.
